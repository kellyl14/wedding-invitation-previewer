# Wedding Invitation Previewer - by Kelly Lindsay 
## Introduction
I was tasked to create a functional web application using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
I needed to demonstrate that I could fork an existing repository and follow the outlines
set out below. The objective was to create a wedding invitation previewer, where the user
could input their details and then preview their details live on their desired wedding
invitation design. There needed to be a minimum of three invitation styles that the user
could select from. 

Below is an image of the project that I created.

# Assessment Requirements
## Objectives

1. Build a site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. Use JavaScript to create a functionable, demonstrable, _presentable_ web
application

## Background

Weddings. They're so stressful they often undermine the success of the endeavor
they were meant to celebrate. We're going to help those newly-engaged by
helping them face one of the big stressors: choosing an invitation format.

Here's a .gif demonstrating what your implementation should do.

### Requirements

1. Couples should be able to choose between 3 possible invitation styles. Upon
selecting a design, the screen should instantly update with the new
look-and-feel
2. Couples should be provided the appropriate input fields so that they can put
in their vital data. Data, as it is entered, should appear _inside_ the
currently active look-and-feel.
3. If you can think of ways to improve user experience, please do so! Our
stressed couples appreciate thoughtful user experience (UX) that helps soother
their addled nerves and nervous bank accounts
4. Be Creative! If you want to corner the market on Goth-asthetic invitations,
**DO IT**. If you think that super-kawaii anime invitations are your fast-track
to riches and wealth **MAKE IT HAPPEN**. Remember this goes in _your_
portfolio. Make sure your work is authentic and true to _you_.

### Non-Requirements

While you're going to use form input elements, you will not be submitting data
to a remote server. You'll be using the power of JavaScript to do live,
on-screen updates. Adding persistence will come in a later iteration ;).
